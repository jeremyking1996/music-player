# Funny music player!

Made a fun music player using cover songs of some of the most famous artists! Utilizing the HTML5 audio API, added event listeners to provide previous, next and
play/pause buttons. As well implemented a progress bar, and can click on it to change where in the song you want to play! Added an animation to start spinning 
on play and stopping on pause. Very fun project and used a lot of DOM traversal methods!
